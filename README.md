# ITSC 3155 Module 9 Assignment

This repository houses the scaffolding for a movie rating application. By the end, this application will fulfill the following user stories / features:

1. As a user, I should be able to view all saved movie ratings in a visually appealing table
2. As a user, I should be able to save a movie rating with the movie's name, director, and a 1-5 rating
3. As a user, I should be able to search for a specific movie rating using the movie's title

## Python Version

You must have Python 3.10.* installed to run this application.

## Instructions

1. Have ***exactly one*** member of your team fork this repository. This team member should also add every other team member as contributors to the fork.
2. ***Every*** member of your team should clone the forked repository. **DO NOT** clone this repository, only clone the forked one. If you clone this repository, the remote will point here and not to the forked repository where you can make changes.
3. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`, activate it, and then install the project dependencies in this environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install everything you need to run `flask` and `pytest`.
4. ***Every*** team member should be assigned a feature to work on.
5. Create a new feature branch for your feature (ex. `implement-create-movies`).
6. Implement the feature and make commits as you go (no strict rules on when to make a commit as long as all your work is commited when you finish).
7. Add appropriate `pytest` tests for your feature. Cover at least the "happy" path and, where applicable, test for "bad" input and edge cases. You should include both unit tests and end-to-end tests.
8. Push your branch with all its commits up to your remote.
9. Make a pull request from your feature branch to the `main` branch.
10. Review another team member's PR. Remember to leave good feedback in comments and request changes if needed. If everything looks good, go ahead and approve it.
11. Merge your PR into `main` once it has been approved by another team member.
12. Verify that your changes look good in `main`.
